<!-- how to mive code to github
after configuring your name and your email.

1....  git init
2....  git add . (give a space before writing the dot)
3....  git commit -m "Initial commit" (you must always add the value)
then go to github,create a repositary and then copy the repositary url then......
4....  git remote add origin <repository-URL>(this is how it works)
If your default branch is named master, use:
5....   git push -u origin master

then you're done, move directly to versel and deploy.
